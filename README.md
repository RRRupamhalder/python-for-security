Custom Listener Tool for Network Monitoring
Technologies Used: Python, Socket Programming, Networking

Project Overview:
Developed a custom listener tool using Python’s socket module to capture and monitor incoming network connections. The tool functions as a basic TCP listener, enabling security professionals to analyze network traffic, detect unauthorized access, and perform penetration testing tasks.

Key Features:
✅ Listens for incoming TCP connections on a specified port
✅ Captures and logs connection details (IP, port, timestamp)
✅ Supports multiple connections using threading
✅ Implements basic command execution for interaction with connected clients
✅ Aids in network reconnaissance and penetration testing

Technical Implementation:
Utilized Python’s socket module to create a server-client architecture

Implemented multi-threading to handle multiple incoming connections

Enabled real-time data logging for analysis and security auditing

Applied basic encryption techniques to secure communication

Impact & Learning Outcomes:
✔ Gained hands-on experience in network security and ethical hacking
✔ Improved understanding of TCP/IP protocols and socket programming
✔ Strengthened knowledge of real-world penetration testing tools
